There's little documentation and tutorials about Wolf RPG Editor, so I'm currently translating the **Japanese Perfect Guide** (you can find it in the wiki). This translation is adapted for the **English 2.24Z package**, not the Japanese version!

I'm not affiliated with Wolf RPG Editor, I use this game engine for some projects.
