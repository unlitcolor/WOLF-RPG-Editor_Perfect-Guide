There's little documentation and tutorials about [Wolf RPG Editor](https://www.silversecond.com/WolfRPGEditor/), so I'm currently translating the **Japanese Perfect Guide** (you can find it in the [wiki](https://github.com/unlitcolor/wolfrpgeditor/wiki)). This translation is adapted for the [English 2.24Z package](https://www.moddb.com/engines/wolf-rpg-editor/downloads/wolf-rpg-editor-english-224z-full-package), not the Japanese version!

I'm not affiliated with Wolf RPG Editor, I use this game engine for some projects.


Note: I use the English 2.24Z package.<br>
